Title: The Starfish Thrower

In a small coastal town, an old man named Oscar spent his days walking along the beach, throwing starfish that had been washed ashore back into the ocean. A young girl approached him and asked why he bothered, as the tide would just wash them up again. Oscar explained that if he didn't help, they would die before the next high tide.

The girl, skeptical of making a difference, pointed out that there were hundreds of starfish along the beach and only one man. Oscar picked up another starfish, tossed it gently into the ocean, and said, "I made a difference for that one." The girl decided to help him, and together they worked their way along the shoreline, rescuing starfish.

The story serves as an analogy of making a positive impact in the world, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant one's actions may seem. It emphasizes that each person has the power to make a difference and encourages empathy and compassion for all living beings.
