>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
1. Burning of Fossil Fuels: The burning of coal, oil, and gas for electricity, heat, and transportation is the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions. These fuels release carbon dioxide (CO2) and other harmful gases into the atmosphere.

2. Deforestation: Trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. When forests are cut down for agricultural purposes or urban development, less CO2 is absorbed, and more is released due to burning of trees.

3. Industrial Processes: Many industrial processes produce greenhouse gases. For example, cement production releases CO2, as do chemical reactions in manufacturing industries.

4. Agriculture: Livestock farming for meat production generates a significant amount of methane (a potent greenhouse gas), especially from the digestive process of ruminant animals like cows and sheep. Rice cultivation also contributes to methane emissions.

5. Waste Management: Decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces methane, which is 28 times more potent than CO2 on a 100-year timeframe.

6. Energy Use in Buildings: Heating, cooling, lighting, and powering appliances in buildings account for about 40% of global energy use. Much of this energy comes from burning fossil fuels.

7. Transportation: The burning of gasoline and diesel fuels in cars, buses, trucks, airplanes, and ships releases CO2 into the atmosphere.

8. Land Use Changes: When agricultural or urban land replaces natural ecosystems (like forests or grasslands), it can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions due to changes in soil management and loss of carbon sinks.

## Prompt 2
> Prompt: Who wrote the play "Hamlet" and what is its central theme?
(Response time: 8.2 seconds)
(CPU Usage: 2.9%, Memory Used: 13989.86 MB / 16088.46 MB (87.0%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
The play "Hamlet" was written by William Shakespeare. Its central theme revolves around morality, mortality, revenge, and the human psyche. The story follows Prince Hamlet as he seeks justice for his father's murder while dealing with internal conflicts and exploring the nature of madness and deceit in the world around him.

## Prompt 3
> Prompt: Explain the theory of general relativity in simple terms.

>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
General Relativity is a theory of gravity that was proposed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. It fundamentally changed our understanding of gravity from being a force between masses, as described in Newton's law of universal gravitation, to being a result of the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy.

Here's a simple breakdown:

1. Space and time are not absolute but rather form a four-dimensional fabric called space-time. This is different from the traditional view where space and time were considered separate entities.

2. Massive objects like planets and stars cause "dents" or "warps" in this fabric of space-time, which is known as gravity. The more mass an object has, the greater the dent or warp it creates.

3. An object moving near a massive object will follow the curve of space-time around that object, just like a ball rolls downhill following the contours of the land. This describes the movement of objects under the influence of gravity.

4. The theory also predicts phenomena such as black holes (extremely dense regions where space-time is so warped that nothing, not even light, can escape) and gravitational waves (ripples in space-time caused by violent acceleration or deceleration of massive objects). These predictions have been confirmed by astronomical observations.

5. One of the most famous equations from General Relativity is E = mc^2, which shows that energy (E) is equivalent to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light squared (c^2). This equation highlights the interchangeability of mass and energy.
