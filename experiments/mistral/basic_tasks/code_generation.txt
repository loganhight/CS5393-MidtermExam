## Prompt 1
> Prompt: Write a Python function to check if a string is a palindrome.

>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
Here's a simple Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome:

```python
def is_palindrome(input_string):
    input_string = input_string.lower()
    reversed_string = input_string[::-1]
    return input_string == reversed_string

# Test cases
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))   # False
```

This function first converts the given string to lowercase. Then it creates a reversed version of the input string using slicing with step -1. Finally, it compares the original and reversed strings to check if they are equal. If they are identical, the function returns True (indicating that the input is a palindrome), otherwise False.

    <h1>Welcome to My Simple Webpage!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML webpage created for demonstration purposes.</p>

## Prompt 3
> Prompt: Write a SQL query to select all customers from a table called `customers` who made purchases over $500 in the last month.
(Response time: 23.39 seconds)
(CPU Usage: 7.9%, Memory Used: 15597.78 MB / 16088.46 MB (97.0%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
To achieve this, we'll make use of `JOIN`, `WHERE`, and date functions in SQL. Here is an example of how you could structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.email
FROM customers AS c
JOIN purchases AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE p.purchase_date >= DATE(NOW()) - INTERVAL 1 MONTH
AND p.amount > 500;
```

This query selects the `customer_id`, `name`, and `email` columns from the `customers` table and uses a join with the purchases table to filter only those customers who made a purchase over $500 in the last month.
