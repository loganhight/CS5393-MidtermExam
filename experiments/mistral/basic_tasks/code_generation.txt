## Prompt 1
> Prompt: Write a Python function to check if a string is a palindrome.
(Response time: 29.13 seconds)
(CPU Usage: 13.0%, Memory Used: 14859.32 MB / 16088.46 MB (92.4%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
Here is a simple Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower()
    s = ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalnum())  # remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
    return s == s[::-1]                       # check if the string is equal to its reverse
```

This function first removes any non-alphanumeric characters from the input string, then checks if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that the given string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Example usage:

```python
>>> is_palindrome('A man, a plan, a canal: Panama')
True

>>> is_palindrome('hello world')
False
```

    <h1>Welcome to the Simple Webpage!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple webpage that contains a title and a paragraph of text.</p>

## Prompt 3
> Prompt: Write a SQL query to select all customers from a table called `customers` who made purchases over $500 in the last month.
(Response time: 24.15 seconds)
(CPU Usage: 8.6%, Memory Used: 14611.25 MB / 16088.46 MB (90.8%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
To write this SQL query, we will first use the `DATE_SUB()` function to get the data for the last month, and then apply filters for customer records with total purchase amount greater than $500. Here's a sample query for MySQL:

```sql
SELECT c.*
FROM customers AS c
INNER JOIN purchases AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE p.purchase_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
AND p.total_amount > 500;
```

This query selects all columns from the customers table (aliased as c) and joins it with the purchases table (aliased as p) on their customer ID. It then filters for records where the purchase date is within the last month and total amount is greater than $500.
