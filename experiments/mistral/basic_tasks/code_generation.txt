## Prompt 1
> Prompt: Write a Python function to check if a string is a palindrome.

>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
Here's a simple Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower()
    s = ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalnum())  # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
    return s == s[::-1]                        # Check if the string is equal to its reverse
```

This function first removes any non-alphanumeric characters from the input string (e.g., spaces, punctuation) and converts all characters to lowercase. Then it checks if the resulting string is equal to its reverse, which indicates that the original string is a palindrome.

You can test this function with various examples:

```python
print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"))  # True
print(is_palindrome("hello world"))                   # False
print(is_palindrome("A Santa at NASA"))                # True
```

## Prompt 2
> Prompt: Create a simple HTML webpage with a title and a paragraph of text.
(Response time: 16.9 seconds)

>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
```html

Title of the Webpage
=====================

Welcome to my simple webpage!
This is a basic example of an HTML document. Here we have a title for the webpage and a paragraph element containing some text. The title tag sets the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. The body element contains all the content that will be visible to the user. The h1 tag defines a heading, and the p tag defines a paragraph.

```

Save this code in a file with a .html extension (e.g., `index.html`) and open it using any web browser to see your simple webpage in action!

## Prompt 3
> Prompt: Write a SQL query to select all customers from a table called `customers` who made purchases over $500 in the last month.
(Response time: 23.59 seconds)
(CPU Usage: 2.3%, Memory Used: 13821.03 MB / 16088.46 MB (85.9%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
To write this SQL query, I'll assume that there is another table called `transactions` where we can join `customers` to get purchase details. Here's an example of how you might structure the query:

```sql
SELECT c.*
FROM customers AS c
JOIN transactions AS t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
WHERE t.transaction_date >= DATE(NOW()) - INTERVAL 1 MONTH
AND t.amount > 500;
```

This query selects all columns from the `customers` table (denoted by `c.*`) and filters for rows where the associated transaction in the last month had an amount greater than $500. The join condition (`ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id`) ensures that we get the corresponding customer details only when there is a matching transaction record in the `transactions` table.
