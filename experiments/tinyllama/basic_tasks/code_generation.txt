>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
Here's a Python function that can help you check whether a given string is a palindrome or not:

```python
def is_palindrome(input_string):
    """
    This function returns True if the input string is a palindrome and False otherwise.
    
    Input: A string
    Output: True/False based on whether the input string is a palindrome or not.
    """
    # check if the input string is empty or None
    if input_string == "" or input_string is None:
        return False
        
    # reverse the input string and try to compare it with itself
    reversed_input_string = input_string[::-1]
    if reversed_input_string == input_string:
        return True
    else:
        return False

## Prompt 3
> Prompt: Write a SQL query to select all customers from a table called `customers` who made purchases over $500 in the last month.
(Response time: 2.16 seconds)
(CPU Usage: 4.3%, Memory Used: 11858.39 MB / 16088.46 MB (73.7%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
To select all customers from a table called "customers" who made a purchase over $500 in the last month using SQL, we can use the "WHERE" clause with an aggregation function like SUM() or AVG(). For example:

```sql
SELECT cust_name, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_spend
FROM customers
WHERE YEAR(purchased_on) = 2019 AND MONTH(purchased_on) = 6 AND PURCHASED_AMOUNT > 500
GROUP BY cust_name
ORDER BY total_spend DESC;
```

In this example, we are selecting all customers from the `customers` table, filtering them based on a condition that they made a purchase in the last month (inclusive of the last day) over $500, and then aggregating their total spend across all transactions. The resulting query will only return the names and aggregate values for the highest spend customers.
