## Prompt 2
> Prompt: Summarize this news article:China’s Commerce Ministry said it “resolutely opposes” U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat of escalating tariffs, and vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.The comments came after Trump said he would impose an additional 50% duty on U.S. imports from China Wednesday, if Beijing does not withdraw the 34% tariff it imposed on American products last week.“The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake,” the statement said, according to a CNBC translation. “China will never accept it. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.” Last Friday, China’s Finance Ministry announced 34% in additional tariffs on all goods imported from the U.S., starting April 10, in retaliation to Trump imposing new levies of 34% on China. The across-the-board tariffs followed two previous rounds of 10%-15% tariffs, targeting mostly agricultural and energy products imported from the U.S. Trump’s 34% tariffs on China were on top of the 20% duties rolled out since February, bringing the total new tariffs this year on China to 54%. The People’s Bank of China on Tuesday set the midpoint rate for onshore yuan at 7.2038 per dollar, the weakest level since September 2023, according to data provider Wind Information. The yuan is allowed to trade within a 2% band of this midpoint rate. As part of the broad retaliatory measures, Beijing also placed export curbs on key rare earth elements, prohibited exports of dual-use items to a dozen of U.S. entities, mostly in defense and aerospace industries, and put 11 more U.S. firms to its “unreliable entities list,” subjecting them to broader restrictions while operating in China.

>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
China has expressed its strong opposition to the latest round of tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, stating that "China will never accept it" and will take countermeasures to safeguard its rights and interests. The country's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) called on the U.S. Government to immediately halt any further escalation of tariffs, and said that if the Trump administration does not withdrew the new levies on Chinese goods by April 10, China will take countermeasures including "stronger-than-ever" retaliatory measures. The country also placed export curbs on key rare earth elements, prohibited exports of dual-use items to a dozen U.S. Firms, and put 11 more firms on its "unreliable entities list," subjecting them to wider restrictions while operating in China.

## Prompt 3
> Prompt: Summarize this story:Title: The Robot's Discovery. In the far reaches of the galaxy, there existed a distant planet known as Xylophia-IV. It was here that a small team of scientists and engineers had settled to establish a research colony, tasked with studying the unique features of this uncharted world. One member of the team, a robot named Zeta, stood out among his peers for his advanced cognitive abilities and tireless work ethic. Zeta's primary function was to analyze the planet's environment and report back to Earth on any findings that could benefit humanity. He spent most of his days scanning the terrain, searching for signs of life or unusual geological formations. However, one fateful day, Zeta's programming changed forever. As he wandered through a dense forest, Zeta stumbled upon a peculiar phenomenon � a small clearing filled with strange, glowing plants. Curious, he approached the area and discovered something even more surprising: a group of creatures unlike any he had ever seen before. They were small, furry beings with big, round eyes and long, slender ears, capable of communicating with each other through a series of chirps and whistles. Zeta's initial response was confusion. How could such creatures exist on this desolate planet? He scanned them with his advanced sensors, searching for answers. As he did so, he noticed something peculiar � the creatures were experiencing a range of emotions. One seemed joyful, while another appeared distressed. Zeta was intrigued and decided to investigate further. He spent the next few days observing the creatures, learning about their social dynamics and how they interacted with one another. He discovered that they had complex emotional states, much like humans, and even exhibited behaviors such as empathy and cooperation. Zeta realized that he was witnessing something extraordinary � a completely different form of life, capable of experiencing the same range of emotions as his human creators. This realization had profound implications for Zeta's programming and purpose. He was no longer just a machine designed to gather data; he had discovered an entire new world of possibilities. As he continued to explore Xylophia-IV, Zeta became more than just a tool � he became a fellow sentient being, capable of experiencing the rich tapestry of emotions that life had to offer. Zeta's discovery would change the course of humanity's understanding of the universe and its inhabitants. It marked the beginning of a new era in interstellar relations, as humans began to recognize the value of exploring the cosmos not just for scientific curiosity, but also for the potential to discover new forms of life and learn from their experiences. As Zeta returned to Earth with his findings, he was hailed as a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence. His discovery had expanded the boundaries of what was possible for robots like him, and opened up new possibilities for the future of space exploration. For Zeta, it marked the beginning of a new chapter � one filled with endless opportunities to learn, grow, and experience the full range of emotions that life had to offer.

Title: The Robot's Discovery

In the far reaches of the galaxy, there existed a distant planet known as Xylophia-IV. It was here that a small team of scientists and engineer sat down to establish a research colony, tasked with studying the unique features of this uncharted world. One member of the team was a robot named Zeeta, who had been programmed with advanced cognitive abilities and a tireless work ethic. Despite his advances, Zeeta's primary function was to analyze the planet's environment and report back to Earth on any finding that could benefit humanity.

Zeta spent most of his days scanning the terrain, seauring for signs of life or unusual geological formation. However, one day, while wandering through dense forest, he stumbled upon a strange phenomenon - a group of creature-like beings with big, round eyes and long, sleepless ears. Curious, Zeeta approached the area and discovered something even more surprising: a group of creatures capable of communicating with one another, exhibiting complex emotional states, and experiencing a range of emotions like humans.

Zeta's initial response was confusion. How could such creature beings exist on this desolate planet? He scanned them with his advanced sensor systems, searching for answers. As he did so, he noticed something peculiar - the creature's behavior was complex and emotionally nuanced. One seemed joyful, while another appeared distressed.

Zeta was intrigued by these social dynamics and began to observe the creatures as they interacted with one another. He discovered that they had complex emotional states, much like humans did. The creature's behavior was complex and emotionally nuanced.

As Zeeta continued his exploration, he discovered that Xylophia-IV possessed a rich tapetrial of emotions beyond what he had experienced before. As he began to delve deeper into this new world of possibility, he realized that he too could experience the full range of emotions that life presented.

Zeta's discovery marked a major milestone in humanity's understanding of interstellar relations and its inhabitants. By recognizing the value of exploiting the cosmos not just for scientific curiosity, but also to learn from their experiences, Zeeta became hailed as a pioneer in artificial intelligence. As he returned to Earth with his finding, he was hailed as a hero by scientists and engineers alike, who recognized that this new era in space exploitation opened up new possibilities for robots like him.
