Amazon to Expand Its Amazon Go Convenience Store Lineup in China
In a bid to tap into the Chinese market for its online retail and e-commerce services, Amazon has announced plans to expand its Amazon Go convenience store lineup in China. The move comes after the company began testing its first-ever brick-and-mortar location in Shanghai last year.
According to reports, the expansion will involve setting up additional Amazon Go stores across major Chinese cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. The new locations are expected to be equipped with high-tech cameras, facial recognition software, and other technological capabilities that allow customers to check out products without ever having to touch anything.
"Our teams have been working on this expansion for some time now," Amazon's Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a statement. "We're thrilled to be able to bring the convenience of Amazon Go to more cities across China, and look forward to welcoming our customers there."
The company hopes that these new locations will help it better compete with competitors like Walmart, Tesla, and Alibaba for consumer attention and market share in a highly populated country like China. In the meantime, Amazon Go already operates several storefronts in major cities such as New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Seattle, where customers can shop without ever having to leave their cars.
"We've been thrilled with the success of our first two brick-and-mortar stores," Bezos said earlier this month. "This is a massive opportunity for us, and we look forward to bringing Amazon Go to more markets across China in the future."
