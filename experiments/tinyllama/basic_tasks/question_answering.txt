(CPU Usage: 9.8%, Memory Used: 11754.71 MB / 16088.46 MB (73.1%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
Climate change is caused by several primary causes:
1. Emissions from human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels and deforestation.
2. Natural processes like ocean acidification, glacier melting and permafrost thaw.
3. Radiation emitted by nuclear power plants or military tests.
4. The increase in greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities.
5. Volcanic activity.
6. Other factors like agriculture and forestry practices, which increase greenhouse gas emissions. 

These main causes lead to the buildup of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, which causes global warming and climate change. The consequences can include sea level rise, droughts, wildfires, extreme weather events like hurricanes and floods, and changes in crop patterns and ecosystems.

## Prompt 2
> Prompt: Who wrote the play "Hamlet" and what is its central theme?
(Response time: 1.78 seconds)
(CPU Usage: 5.6%, Memory Used: 11748.06 MB / 16088.46 MB (73.0%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
"Hamlet," also known as "The Unknown," is a play written by the French author Jean-Jacques Mourquy. The play's central theme explores the theme of secrecy, deception, and betrayal in the context of political intrigue and espionage. The main character, a young man named Antoine, who is tasked with spying on a group of conspirators who are plotting to overthrow the French government, becomes entangled in their web of lies and deceit.

As the play progresses, Antoine becomes more and more disillusioned with his mission and begins to question the legitimacy of the revolutionary cause itself. The play ultimately highlights the dangers and complexities of political intrigue and espionage, as well as the destructive power of secrecy and deception in shaping human relationships and understanding.

> Prompt: Explain the theory of general relativity in simple terms.

>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
In physics, general relativity is one of the most important theoretical frameworks that attempts to unify gravity with the rest of the classical physics. It proposes a new way of understanding how space and time behave in the context of massive bodies like planets, stars, and galaxies. The theory was developed by Albert Einstein over 100 years ago and has since been tested through various observations and experiments. Here are some simple explanations for the theory:

1. Gravity: General relativity explains how gravity works in the context of massive objects like planets or stars. It posits that the pull of gravity is equivalent to a weight on a scale, which is affected by the mass of the body. The force of gravity depends on the curvature of spacetime (the curvature of space-time is related to gravity), and this curvature is affected by the position and mass of the object.

2. Time: General relativity proposes that time is not a simple continuum but an abstract concept, based on how we perceive and interpret the passage of events. Gravity also affects time according to the theory - it causes objects to move at a faster pace in the vicinity of a massive body, while moving at slower speeds farther away.

3. Mass: General relativity explains how mass affects gravity. As mass is concentrated closer to a massive object, its gravitational pull becomes stronger and its effects on space-time are more pronounced. The theory also proposes that the acceleration of a massive body due to gravity depends on its mass and distance from the observer.

4. Gravitons: General relativity also posits the existence of "gravitons" or gravitational waves. These waves carry information about the presence of large masses and their effects on space-time, but they are not directly observable. The theory uses Einstein's equations to predict the properties of these waves, which include mass, energy, momentum, and other characteristics.

These are just a few examples of how general relativity explains gravity. By combining the concepts of spacetime, mass, and gravity, this theory has greatly improved our understanding of how the universe works.
