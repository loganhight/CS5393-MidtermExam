Title: New Study Finds Link Between Social Media Use and Mental Health in Teenagers

Summary: A new study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania has found a significant link between social media use and mental health issues in teenagers. The study, which analyzed data from over 50,000 teenagers aged 13-18, found that teens who spent more time on social media were more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. The study also found that the risk of mental health issues increased with the amount of time spent on social media. The researchers suggest that excessive social media use may be contributing to the rising rates of mental health issues among teenagers.
