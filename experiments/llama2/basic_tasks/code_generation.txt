## Prompt 1
> Prompt: Write a Python function to check if a string is a palindrome.

>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
```
def is_palindrome(str):
    """
    Returns True if the given string is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """
    return str == str[::-1]
```
Explanation:

* The function takes a single argument `str`, which is the string to be checked.
* We use the slicing notation `[::-1]` to get the characters of the string in reverse order.
* We then compare the original string with the reversed string using the `==` operator.
* If the strings are equal, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> is_palindrome("racecar")
True
>>> is_palindrome("hello")
False
```
Note that this function will only work for strings of length greater than 1. For shorter strings, the comparison will always return `False`.

## Prompt 2
> Prompt: Create a simple HTML webpage with a title and a paragraph of text.
(Response time: 12.33 seconds)
(CPU Usage: 4.0%, Memory Used: 13762.19 MB / 16088.46 MB (85.5%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <title>My Simple Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
 <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>

Note: This is a very basic HTML structure, and there are many things you can add to make it more complex and functional, such as images, links, forms, tables, etc.

## Prompt 3
> Prompt: Write a SQL query to select all customers from a table called `customers` who made purchases over $500 in the last month.
(Response time: 29.86 seconds)
(CPU Usage: 5.8%, Memory Used: 13767.53 MB / 16088.46 MB (85.6%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
```
SELECT * 
FROM customers 
WHERE total_purchase > 500 AND date_purchased > DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
```
Explanation:

* `SELECT *` selects all columns from the `customers` table.
* `FROM customers` specifies the table to query.
* `WHERE total_purchase > 500` filters the results to only include customers who made purchases over $500.
* `AND date_purchased > DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 MONTH)` filters the results further to only include customers who made purchases in the last month. `DATE_SUB` subtracts one month from the current date.

Note: This assumes that the `total_purchase` column is a sum of all the products purchased by each customer, and the `date_purchased` column is the date when the purchase was made. If your table has different columns or formatting, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.
