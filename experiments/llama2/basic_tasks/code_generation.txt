## Prompt 1
> Prompt: Write a Python function to check if a string is a palindrome.

>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
Here's a simple function that checks if a string is a palindrome:
```
def is_palindrome(s):
    """
    Returns True if the given string is a palindrome, False otherwise.

    A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

    Args:
        s (str): The string to be checked for palindromicity.

    Returns:
        bool: Whether the given string is a palindrome.
    """
    return s == s[::-1]
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. `s[::-1]` creates a slice of the input string that starts at the end and moves backwards to the beginning, character by character.
2. The `==` operator checks if the slice is equal to the original string. If it is, then the string is a palindrome.

Here are some examples of how you can use this function:
```
# Testing the function with some sample strings
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))   # False
print(is_palindrome("level"))  # True
```
This function should work for any string, regardless of its length or content.

## Prompt 2
> Prompt: Create a simple HTML webpage with a title and a paragraph of text.
(Response time: 87.19 seconds)
(CPU Usage: 10.8%, Memory Used: 13856.22 MB / 16088.46 MB (86.1%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
Sure! Here's an example of a simple HTML webpage with a title and a paragraph of text:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Simple Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is a simple webpage with a title and a paragraph of text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
Let me explain what each part of this code does:

* `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares the document type as HTML5.
* `<html>` is the root element of the HTML document.
* `<head>` contains metadata about the document, such as the title and links to external stylesheets or scripts.
* `<title>` sets the title of the webpage.
* `<body>` contains the content of the webpage, which in this case is just a paragraph of text.
* `<p>` is an HTML element that creates a paragraph of text.

This code will create a webpage with a title and a single paragraph of text. You can save this code to a file with an .html extension (e.g., "my-simple-webpage.html") and open it in a web browser to see the finished product.

## Prompt 3
> Prompt: Write a SQL query to select all customers from a table called `customers` who made purchases over $500 in the last month.
(Response time: 77.9 seconds)
(CPU Usage: 3.6%, Memory Used: 14086.51 MB / 16088.46 MB (87.6%))
>>> MODEL OUTPUT:
Here's the SQL query to select all customers from the `customers` table who made purchases over $500 in the last month:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM customers 
WHERE purchase_amount > 500 AND purchase_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
```
Explanation:

* `SELECT *` selects all columns from the `customers` table.
* `WHERE purchase_amount > 500` filters the customers based on the `purchase_amount` column, and only selects those with amounts greater than $500.
* `AND purchase_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)` filters the customers based on the `purchase_date` column, and only selects those who made purchases within the last month. The `DATE_SUB` function subtracts one month from the current date, and the `INTERVAL 1 MONTH` specifies that we want to consider only purchases made within the last month.

This query will return all customers who have made purchases over $500 in the last month.
